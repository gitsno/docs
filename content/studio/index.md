## 1 Introduction 

The Mendix Platform includes [Mendix Studio](general) in addition to [Mendix Studio Pro](/refguide/modeling). Studio is a collaborative, no-code, web-based application development environment.

Studio enables you to do the following: 

* Develop application user interfaces with styled building blocks and widgets
* Create domain models for reading and writing data in an application
* Visually model the interactions and flow control of an application
* Leverage your enterprise design language to create engaging apps that conform to company standards beyond branding and theming
