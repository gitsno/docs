## 1 Introduction

As described in [Mendix & Integration](mendix-integration#functionally), Mendix recommends always thinking of integration from a functional perspective first. The main question you should ask is, what will this integration do for the business solution?

## 2 Deciding on the Best Integration Option

This is an example sequence for an Architect or Lead Developer considering the best way to integrate:

1. What is the business use case? <br />
	a. Use this document to see if one use csase fits?
2. What are the functional requirements? <br />
	a.  Who needs what data when and for which reason? <br />
	b. Does it need to be real-time? <br />
	c. What error handling should be there?
3.  What are the functional options? <br />
	a. How can I operate this interface in production? <br />
	b. How do we manage errors? <br />
	c. Real-time or batch? <br />
	d. Request–reply or events? <br />
	e.  Is there an available integration layer? <br />

	* If yes, what functions does it handle (for example security, monitoring, queueing, simple mapping)? <br />
	* An "integration layer" means there are two parts of the integration where you one can choose events, request–reply, or batch separately for the best possible operational solution

4. What are the technical options for each functional option? <br />
	a. Which protocols are available? <br />
	b. What will it mean for operations? <br />
	c. What is more secure? <br />
	d. What has better error handling?
5. Compare the options against each other.

It is important to think of the overall solution, and recognize that integration starts inside one system and ends inside (one-to-many) other systems.

If it gets complicated on one side of an integration, it is often because the other side of the integration is not ideal. Then, the best solution may be to try to change the other side of the integration.

## 3 Integration Use Cases

The integration use cases are introduced below.

{{% todo %}}[**ADD LINKS TO FULL DOCS BELOW ONCE AVAILABLE**]{{% /todo %}}

### 3.1 SSO, AD & Identity Integration 

This use case handles security around the following:

* User login integration using standard SSO (for example, SAML and Open ID)
* Service integration (for example, SSL, tokens, and encryption)
* Events (for example, securing data on queues)
* Batch interfaces (for example, using SFTP)

### 3.2 Importing & Distributing Reference Data 

This use case describes how to manage reference data, such as country codes, currencies, and  product sets. These slow-changing datasets are often maintained in another system and regularly imported into an app (for example, from a CSV file).

Along with a microservices cluster, Mendix recommends using one app as the reference data-importing point and then distributing data from there to the rest of the apps.

### 3.3 Viewing & Searching Data in Another System 

A typical case for integration is using one app to view or search data from another system. This is a simple functional use case, but it has a few technical options that are worth understanding.

### 3.4 Using & Referring to Data in Another System

This use case describes how to search and view data in another system as well as store parts of the data locally and set up a functional link between the objects. With such a link, you can  subscribe to updates, reretrieve a new version of the data on request later, or configure a downstream system (for example, finance) to use the reference for its processing.

### 3.5 Process Integration

Process integration is the most common integration type in most enterprises. As soon as a business process spans more than one app, there is usually some level of process integration needed. For example, when an end-user submits an order in an ordering system, it should go to a fulfilment system and maybe after that to finance. And of course you will want to also inform the customer.

Read more in [Process Integration](process-integration).

### 3.6 Export, Import & Batch Processing

Even in a real-time world, there is plenty of integration that still makes sense to do in a batch-oriented way. Batch integration is usually decoupled, because one step extracts a file, another step moves the file, and a third step imports the file.

This is a great option for reference data and other periodically updated data as well as for initial loads and exports towards DWH solutions, for example.

Read more in [Export, Import & Batch Processing](export-import-batch).

### 3.7 Master Data Integration

Master data consists of semi-permanent objects that are used throughout several business processes. That means that several processes and/or departments use the same objects (and often also change the same objects). The most common example is customer data, where a  customer may order products from five different departments but needs to be treated as the same customer.

In its full scope, master data management is a complex process involving the following:

* A central place where the master copy of the data is stored
* Several mechanisms for updating the master data
* A (normally human) workflow that is managed by data stewards in order to resolve conflicts and de-duplicate data
* One or more mechanisms for distributing updates to the master data

The best practices will describe how to update data in the master app and how to distribute the data to other subscribing apps.

### 3.8 CMS & CDN Integration 

Mendix often needs to integrate with content management systems (CMS) like Magnolia. This allows for external facing apps to have a main menu and marketing material in a CMS system that is specialized for these purposes, while Mendix runs the functional part of the portal.

This use case will also discuss Mendix integration with content delivery node solutions (such as Akamai) for geo-scaled solutions.

### 3.9 Integration with BI & Reporting

This use case describes several options for how Mendix developers can provide data from the apps towards a DWH, data lake, or other BI tooling using, for example, files, OData, or database dumps.s

This use case will also look at creating reports in Mendix apps and integration with data mining tools like Tableau.

### 3.10 Integration with CICD, Ops & Monitoring 

DevOps is rolling out around the world and many processes—from development and testing to deploying and monitoring—are being automated. Together with cloud and low-code technologies, DevOps is contributing to the digital transformation of the IT industry.

Integration from functional apps towards this automation and operations tooling is becoming increasingly important. These areas will be covered in the use cases:.

* CI/CD integration
* Test automation (building specific test services)
* App management
* Health checks and basic monitoring
* Business activity monitoring
* Professional monitoring and trend analysis
* Security monitoring

DevOps involves collaborating and using the same (or similar) tools to improve the
flexibility of releasing functionality more often while maintaining stable solutions in production.

### 3.11 Integration with AI & IoT Solutions

{{% todo %}}[**"Google" BELOW? NO DOCS ON GOOGLE, BUT EXIST ON SAP - VERIFY**]{{% /todo %}}

Mendix already integrates well with AI solutions from [IBM](/refguide/ibm/ibm-watson-connector) and Google and with IoT solutions such as [Siemens MindSphere](/howto/mindsphere/). 

This use case describes what to think for this type of integration and provides simple example implementations to use as references.
