## 1 Introduction

Scout has not been updated for Windows 10. Therefore, Windows 10 users need to use a workaround.

## 2 Requirements for the Workaround

* You need a 32-bit Java 7 runtime
    * You can use [Ninite Air Java 7](http://ninite.com/air-java7) to get the right version or download it yourself
* Run Windows in English using the **Settings** panel to make **US English** the default
    * Note that this changes your desktop language!
* A rather well-hidden option should be used to set the language for non-Unicode programs to US English
    * Use the search task bar icon to find the control panel and open it, then select **Region** > **Administrative** tab
    * The language for non-Unicode programs must be set to US English
